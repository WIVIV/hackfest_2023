### Problem Statement
Cashflow lending is predicated on analysts cranking out Diary Notes (DNs) and Credit Memos (CMs). We have automated the spreading, calculation of financial ratios, and modeling of PDs. However, the completion of DNs and CMs is still manual.

### Solution
We propose using LLMs (Language Model-based Lending Machines) to query and analyze financial reports, enabling a more efficient credit analysis workflow. Our solution involves building a web app that augments the current workflow by producing draft DNs and CMs. Analysts can then refine these drafts prior to submission.

### Time to Market
We estimate a time frame of 6 months to develop and implement this solution. To ensure the best outcome, we recommend developing it in conjunction with Front Line teams to gather input from bankers.

### Demo
We have developed a rough Proof of Concept (PoC) using LangChain and Deep Lake. Initially, we utilized the ChatGPT API, but the final implementation will use a different LLM, which can be privately hosted within our own environment. We assure you that no proprietary data will be sent outside the bank's network.
